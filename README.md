# Figma To HTML
Figma to HTML is a process of converting a design created in Figma into HTML code to build a website or web application based on that design. It involves extracting the design elements, such as images, fonts, colors, and layout, and translating them into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. This allows developers to bring the visual design from Figma to life on the web.
